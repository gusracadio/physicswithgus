                        <p>In light of the Covid-19 epidemic I am lucky enough not to have lost someone close to me. However, one death that did resonate with me was that of John H Conway. The charismatic English mathematician, active in many parts of modern mathematics passed away due to complications with Covid-19. Conway was a light hearted optimist, epitomized by his self titled, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604079">'Free Will Theorem'</a> [1]. </p>
                        <p>Published in the Foundations of Physics in 2006, John Conway and Simon Kochen revealed one of their most contentious theorems. Stating, if free will is used when taking measurements of a particle, then its outcome is equally not a function of the information accessible to the particles. </p>
                        <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/news/2009/03/23/high-powered-mathematicians-take-free-will"><center><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/20090310_ConwayKochen_DJA_120-i.jpg" alt="..." /></center></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">Conway (right) and Kochen (left) formulating their theory on a chalkboard in Kochen’s fifth-floor office in Fine Hall, Princeton.</span>
                        <p>To first understand the Free Will theorem we must go back to the <a href="about.html">EPR paradox</a> and how the brightest minds in quantum mechanics debunked Einstein. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Bell's Inequality</h2>
                        <p>Almost 30 years after the EPR paradox, John Stewart Bell proved that quantum physics is incompatible with local hidden-variable theories. Bell had devised a way to experimentally test the metaphysics proposed in the EPR paradox [7].<p>
                        <p>The proof of Bells inequality will not be talked about but you can find more information <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bell-theorem/">here.</a> <p>
                        </p> Bell stated an inequality that worked under the assumption that all particles had local hidden-variables. When the inequality was violated by experimental data one of three things about local hidden-variables had to be incorrect [3].</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Realism: Objects have physical quantities when they are not being measured</li>
                            <li>Locality: Cause and effect is consistent with special relativity</li>
                            <li>Freedom: The experimenters have free will to choose which measurements to perform</li>
                          </ol>
                        <p>Bell's theorem established that <strong>no physical theory of local hidden variables can ever reproduce all of the predictions of quantum mechanics</strong> [3].</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Kochen-Specker Paradox</h2>
                        <p>Yes, the same Kochen that partnered Conway on the Free Will Theorem devised an earlier paradox, alongside Ernst Specker. This paradox assumes hidden variables leading to a contradiction with itself. </p>
                        <p>First, I must introduce you to the concept of the SPIN axiom. Without going into too much detail the squared spin of a single particle is a permutation of 1,0,1 [6]. Imagine measuring the spin of an electron along three mutually orthogonal (at right angles) directions. The possible values are:
                            <ul>
                                <li>parallel to the direction (+1)</li>
                                <li>perpendicular to the direction (0)</li>
                                <li>anti-parallel to the direction (-1)</li>
                              </ul>
                              The squared spin means that the anti parallel direction of spin -1 will become 1. Hence, we get for three orthogonal directions permutations of 1,0,1 [6].</p>
                        <p>Now have a look at the first photo below. We have three lines through the centre of box. Two in black and one in grey. The black lines represent squared spin 1 while the grey lines represent squared spin 0. Conway described this as putting 'knitting needles' of different colour through a box [4].</p>
                        <center><a href="https://plus.maths.org/content/proof-kochen-specker-theorem"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/Picture1.jpg" alt="..." /></a><a href="https://plus.maths.org/content/proof-kochen-specker-theorem"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/KS THEOREM SQUARE.jpg" alt="..." /></a></center>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">A Peres cube, grey lines describe squared spin 0, black line describe squared spin 1, the blue line can be 0 or 1.</span>
                        <p>The process  was repeated for the shape on the second image. This is known as a Peres square and has 33 places in which you can put these 'knitting needles'.<p>
                        <p> Keen observers may see the blue line in the second image. This is the crux of the paradox. The blue line can have a squared spin value of 0 and 1 simultaneously [2]. If spin is governed by hidden variables, which always have a fixed value prior to measurement, how can this direction have both values at the same time?</p>
                        <p>Kochen and Specker proved that <strong>properties of a particle cannot have a fixed or definite value prior to measurement</strong> [6]. Simply, hidden variables could not provide the answer to the EPR paradox. More information can be found <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kochen-specker/#:~:text=The%20KS%20Theorem%20claims%20the,%3D3%20and%20y%3D117.">here,</a> regarding the details of KS Theorem. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Axioms of Free Will</h2>
                        <p>The Conway-Kochen proof of the Free Will Theorem relies on three axioms called SPIN, FIN and TWIN</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>SPIN</b>:
                                The squared spin component of certain elementary particles of spin one, taken in three orthogonal directions, will be a permutation of (1,0,1) </li>
                                <li><b>FIN</b>:
                                 There is a finite upper bound to the speed with which information can be effectively transmitted</li>
                                <li><b>TWIN</b>:
                                It is possible to entangle two elementary particles and separate them by a significant distance, so that they have the same squared spin results if measured in parallel directions</li>
                            </ul>
                            <a href="https://medium.com/@jasvir/conways-proof-of-free-will-2aa2ac168dda"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/FIN SPIN TWIN" alt="..."  /></a> 
                        <p>These axioms are stated without proof, however, SPIN and TWIN are experimentally verifiable [1]. The most contentious being FIN, that information cannot travel faster than, <strong>c</strong>, the speed of light. Conway stated that if you disagreed with his conclusion, you also disagree with one of these axioms [4]. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Free Will Theorem</h2>
                        <p>From these 3 axioms, Conway and Kochen concluded, the spin of a particle is dependent solely on the direction from which it was measured and not on its history [7]. But we have already seen from the Kochen-Specker paradox, there is no way for a particle to pre-determine its spin in every direction in a way consistent with SPIN. Hence, if the experimenters are free to make choices about what measurements to take, then the results of their measurements cannot be pre-determined by anything before the experiments.</p>
                        <p>The proof of the theorem is not too long but very wordy and can be found <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0604079'>here.</a> The theorem states: <div><strong>"If the choice of a particular type of spin 1 experiment is not a function of the information accessible to the experimenters, then its outcome is equally not a function of the information accessible to the particles."</strong></div></p>  
                        <p>But what does this mean? Are electrons sentient?</p>
                        <p>This is not the same type of free will that we perceive [5]. In no way is Conway trying to say that particles make a conscience decision on what spin to have. Merely, the particles response is not determined by past history.</p>
                        <p>The Free Will theorem challenges many famous philosophical standpoints. Most famously, René Descartes' dualism. Descartes believed the human mind enabled free will while everything outside of the mind is governed by determinism [5]. The Free Will Theorem is in direct contradiction to this by providing a degree of free will to material objects.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the Free Will theorem implies that any correct theory (not just those extending quantum mechanics) must be incomplete [2]. This is because the particles haven't yet decided what they are going to do. Conway states, 'A correct theory cannot predict what has yet to be decided!'. This implication is aligned with the views of Einstein, that quantum mechanics is indeed incomplete, but provides an  explanation  for it. </p>
                        <p>In the grand scheme of things the 'free will' of a particle doesn't really mean much. There is no way currently to verify the theorem and it remains metaphysics. Conway made the analogy that for all the particles in a chair half may decide to be spin up while the others spin down, causing them to cancel, keeping the chair in place [4]. In his <a href='https://paw.princeton.edu/article/conway-lectures'>6 lectures at Princeton on The Free Will Theorem</a>, Conway concluded that he believed in free will. Raising a piece of chalk and saying, 'I have the choice to drop it or continue to hold it' [4].</p>
                        <p>In his closing remarks, Conway suggested, without any proof, the cumulative freewill of particles is the source of his freewill as a person.</p>
                        <p>So as you close this article ask yourself, was it you or the particles that comprise your brain that chose?</p>
