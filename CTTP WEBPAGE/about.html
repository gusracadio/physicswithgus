                    <p>It is inert to human nature to believe that we have free choice. From the mundane to life alterning decisions, they can't be selected for us, right? Life that is deterministic would be predictable, boring. Yet, life is a bubbling, ever changing cacophony with no predictable rhythm. It's terrifying to think the choices we make are out of our control, set in stone for all time. </p>
                    <p>Until only the last century it was widley accepted, by physicists, that we live in a deterministic universe. Newtonian mechanics being the main reason for this. How ironic the people that preach the vast expanse of the cosmos believe everything is a predetermined set of events, with which we have no control. </p>
                    <p>The earliest acknowledgements of free will is from Greek philisophers in the 4th century BC. Identified in one of the earliest works from Alexander of Aphrodisias, 'What makes us have control over things is the fact that we are causally undetermined in our decision'  </p>
                    <p>However, modern libertarianism (free will) has been shaped with the help of quantum mechanics. We start by discussing Einstien's nihilistic view of a deterministic universe.</p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">The EPR paradox</h2>
                    <p>Proposed in 1935 by, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen, the aptly named EPR paradox assumed that the physical state of a particle is controlled by 'hidden-variables’.<p>
                    <p><a href="https://medium.com/quantum-physics/on-aerts-overlooked-solution-to-the-epr-paradox-ad6d681edf1d"><center><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/einstein rosen podolksy" alt="..." /></center></a></p>
                    <span class="caption text-muted">Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen</span>
                    <p>The EPR paradox was a thought experiment that stated, if there are 2 entangled particles with opposite spin such that when one particles spin is measured, one knows the spin of the other particle instantaneously [2]. This is in direct contradiction with special relativity: that no information can travel faster than the speed of light. Einstien would later describe the paradox by the now famous <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/04/einstein-s-spooky-action-distance-spotted-objects-almost-big-enough-see">'spooky action at a distance'</a>. <p>   
                    <p>This was an attack on the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, effectively EPR were poking holes in quantum theory, proclaming it was 'not complete' in the 1935 paper, <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.47.777">'Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?'</a> [2].<p>
                    <p>How do the particles communicate instantaneously?</p>
                    <p>According to Einstein, so called 'Hidden Variables' [2]. These were characteristics of the quantum particles that we have not measured hence the 'hidden' part. This suggested that the spin of one particle is always spin up and the other always spin down from the begininng of their conception. This conserved the fact information cannot travel faster than the speed of light and provided no contradiction to special relativity. All was good according to Einstien, quantum particles were governed by hidden variables. Pre-determined for all time.</p>
